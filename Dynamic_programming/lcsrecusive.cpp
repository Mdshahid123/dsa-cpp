//Brute Force Approach Using Vectors
//Steps:

// Generate all subsequences of s1 and store them in a vector<string>.
// Generate all subsequences of s2 and store them in another vector<string>.
// Find the longest common subsequences by comparing the two vectors.

// Time Complexity Analysis
// Generating all subsequences:

// Each string of length n has 2^n subsequences.
// Generating subsequences takes O(2^n) per string.
// Finding common subsequences:

// Finding an element in a vector takes O(n).
// O(2^n * 2^m) worst-case comparisons.
// Overall Complexity:

// O(2^n + 2^m + 2^n * 2^m) â†’ O(2^n + 2^m) (Exponential).
